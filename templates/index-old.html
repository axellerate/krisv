	Computation as well as the internet has granted us a vast array of tools that each and every one of us use on a day-to-day basis. It has given birth to a never before seen age of information transfer and automation that is almost beyond imagination.

The website data stored in a server far, far way is read, packed up and transfered at the speed of light through a network that finds its way all the way to your household. It is then interpreted by your browser, contructed and shown to you - all within about a second or so. Simply amazing!</p>
